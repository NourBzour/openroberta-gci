## Coding

Many of our Coding tasks are done via the [Lab](https://lab.open-roberta.org/), creating interesting programs to share them with others.
Make sure to check out the [Wiki](https://jira.iais.fraunhofer.de/wiki/display/ORInfo) for some general information about the robots and how to program them.

### Lab tasks

In these tasks you have to create a program in and for our [Lab](https://lab.open-roberta.org/).
It consists of a block based programming language called NEPO, which can be used to program many different robots.
As you probably do not own a robot, we offer a simulation for the following robots:
- EV3
- NXT
- Calliope
- micro:bit

To get comfortable using the Lab you should do the task "Welcome to the world of Roberta" first. Here you should get introduced to the Lab.

All of our tasks are solvable with the simulation and require no hardware.
The target audience of your programs are other Lab users.
Try to document your thought process and remember that your program is supposed to showcase and explain a specific behaviour.

If you pick one of these tasks the following steps are required:
- Create the specified program using the Lab
- Document your usage of blocks (with comment blocks) and why you are doing things in a specific way
- Use the program comment to give a general introduction to your program
- Export the XML or use the "create program link" to supply us with your program
- Supply any additional information needed as required by the specific task

If your task specifies to upload a video, use a screen recording program and upload it to YouTube using the "Creative Commons 0" license.
For screenshots upload it using the "Creative Commons 0" license to a image hosting platform.

### GitHub tasks

These tasks are very advanced and require knowledge of git, GitHub, and Java.

Here you will contribute to our [source code](https://github.com/OpenRoberta/openroberta-lab) directly.
We will have tasks available to showcase the pull request workflow necessary to successfully integrate your changes into the Lab.

Be sure to tackle the task "Building the project" first.
