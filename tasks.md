## Tasks

We offer different kinds of tasks, wether you are into coding, design or open source in general.

Get additional information about how to approach Coding tasks [here](./coding.md) and Design tasks [here](./design.md).
For the others all information is included within the task.

Some of our tasks have additional labels, the "beginner" tasks are suited as starting tasks, while the "advanced" tasks should only be tackled once you are very comfortable with the Lab. "Expert" tasks require additional knowledge such as Java or Javascript programming.

No matter the context of your work you should start with the task "Welcome to the world of Roberta" to get a feeling of the Lab and how it is used.
