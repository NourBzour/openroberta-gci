## Tasks

We offer different kinds of tasks, whether you are into coding, design or open source in general.

Get additional information about how to approach Coding tasks [here](./coding.md) and Design tasks [here](./design.md).
For the others all information is included within the task.

In addition to the usual *beginner* tasks we have some tags which classify the experience needed for each task.
Our *novice* tasks should be suitable for everyone who has done some *beginner* tasks, while *advanced* requires some more knowledge in the project.
The hardest ones are tagged with *expert*.

No matter the context of your work you should start with the beginner task TBD to get a feeling of the Lab and how it is used. Depending on the area other good tasks are TBD and TBD.

If your task requires a larger write up it is best to create a [Google Doc](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) and provide a link.

If your task specifies to provide a video, use a screen recording program ([Windows 10](https://betanews.com/2019/01/14/windows-10-screen-recorder-ultility/), [Ubuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/06/gnome-shell-screen-recorder-ubuntu)) to capture the necessary material.
